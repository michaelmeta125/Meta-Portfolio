# Michael Meta &ndash; Software Developer

## E-Portfolio CS 499

### This E-Portfolio was created to demonstrate my skills in 3 main categories within the Computer Science Scope
  - Software Design & Engineering
  - Data Structures & Algorithms
  - Databases

----
In order to demonstrate proficiency in these 3 areas, I have first picked an artifact related to history within the computer science field, specifically within my current role. This artifact's larger picture is a full landing page, but the partifuclar artifact is centered around a web api with that will return a list of reports. At the end of this artifact, I will also show an example of its use case.
